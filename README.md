# ScreenShotsWithLoadingTimes
Set URL, set selector for links and off it goes


Set the URL and a selector for all the links on your page.

The script will select all the links at the given url with the given selector and 
will loop trough the list. At each page will measure the time taken to load the page and
it will generate a screen shot.

This is it.
