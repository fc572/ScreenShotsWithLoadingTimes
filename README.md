# ScreenShotsWithLoadingTimes
Open ScreenShotWithLoadingTimes.js and set your base URL. 

The script will select all the links at the given url with the given selector and 
will loop trough the list. At each page will measure the time taken to load the page and
it will generate a screen shot. The load times are stored in a file called Loading Times.txt and the
screenshots are saved in the directory called screenshots. To run the script open a cmd windows 
to the directory where ScreenShotWithLoadingTimes.js is located and at the prompt 
type "phantomjs ScreenShotWithLoadingTimes.js"

This is it.
